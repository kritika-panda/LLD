The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them. Itâ€™s especially useful when integrating legacy code or third-party libraries into a new system.

ðŸ§© Core Components
| Component | Role | 
| Target | The interface expected by the client | 
| Adaptee | The existing class with an incompatible interface | 
| Adapter | Converts the Adapteeâ€™s interface into the Targetâ€™s interface | 
| Client | Uses the Target interface without knowing about the Adapter or Adaptee | 



ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Analogy
Think of a power adapter: your laptop plug doesnâ€™t fit the socket in another country, 
so you use an adapter to make it compatible. Similarly, in code, the adapter translates one interface into another.
