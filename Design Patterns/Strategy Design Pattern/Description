- Strategy Interface: Declares a method (e.g., sort()).
- Concrete Strategies: Implement variations of the behavior.
- Context Class: Uses a Strategy object and delegates to it.
- Client Code: Configures which Strategy to use.

The Strategy Design Pattern is all about defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, 
and making them interchangeable at runtime â€” without altering the client code that uses them. 
It's one of the most intuitive and powerful patterns for achieving flexibility in behavior.

ðŸ§  Core Idea
"Let the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it."
Instead of hardcoding logic, you define different strategies (algorithms) and swap them as needed.


ðŸš€ Use Cases
| Scenario | Why Strategy Works | 
| Sorting Algorithms | Flexible based on data size or distribution | 
| Payment Gateways | Plug in different processors (PayPal, Stripe) | 
| Compression Formats | Switch between ZIP, RAR, GZIP dynamically | 
| Logging Frameworks | Choose console vs file vs DB logging at runtime | 



ðŸ›¡ Benefits
- Open for extension: Add new strategies without touching existing logic
- Decouples algorithm from client: Enhances modularity
- Promotes SOLID principles: Especially Open/Closed and Single Responsibility
