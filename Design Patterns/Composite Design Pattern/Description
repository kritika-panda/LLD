The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and 
compositions of objects uniformly. It’s ideal when you want to build hierarchical structures (like trees) — 
and clients shouldn’t care whether they’re dealing with a single item or a group.

🌳 Core Concept
“Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.”

You define a common interface for both leaf and composite nodes, so the client can interact with any node in 
the structure without special logic.

Key Components
| Role | Description | 
| Component | Common interface for all nodes | 
| Leaf | Represents individual objects | 
| Composite | Represents groups of Components | 
| Client | Works with Component uniformly |
