1. Structure & Participants
Your system has a base abstract class:
- LogProcessor – defines the log() method and stores the next processor in the chain.
And three concrete subclasses:
Class  Handles Log Level  Action Taken
InfoLogProcessor  INFO (1)  Prints INFO: message
DebugLogProcessor  DEBUG (2)  Prints DEBUG: message
ErrorLogProcessor  ERROR (3)  Prints ERROR: message
Each one either handles the log message or passes it to the next.
---
:gear: 2. How the Chain Works in Practice
This part of your main() method builds the chain like this:
`java
LogProcessor logObject = new InfoLogProcessor(
                             new DebugLogProcessor(
                                 new ErrorLogProcessor(null)));
`
This sets up a sequence like:
`
InfoLogProcessor → DebugLogProcessor → ErrorLogProcessor → null
`
So now, any log message sent to logObject starts at the beginning of the chain and passes through each node until it’s either handled or reaches the end.

:dart: 3. Execution Flow: Line by Line
`java
logObject.log(LogProcessor.ERROR, "exception happens");
`
- InfoLogProcessor: can’t handle → passes to
- DebugLogProcessor: can’t handle → passes to
- ErrorLogProcessor: handles it ➤ prints:
  `
  ERROR: exception happens
  `
---
`java
logObject.log(LogProcessor.DEBUG, "need to debug this");
`
- InfoLogProcessor: can’t handle → passes to
- DebugLogProcessor: handles it ➤ prints:
  `
  DEBUG: need to debug this
  `
---
`java
logObject.log(LogProcessor.INFO, "just for info");
`
- InfoLogProcessor: handles it directly ➤ prints:
  `
  INFO: just for info
  `
---
:white_check_mark: 4. Why This Pattern Works So Well Here
- Modular: Each processor is focused on one responsibility.
- Flexible: Want to add TraceLogProcessor or WarningLogProcessor? Just drop it in the chain—no other class needs to change.
- Maintainable: No bloated if-else logic or switch statements packed into a single class.
- Decoupled: The sender (Main) doesn’t care who handles the message—it just sends and lets the chain sort it out.
