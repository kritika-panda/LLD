Memento Design Pattern—a behavioral pattern that’s all about capturing and 
restoring an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation. Think of it like a “save game” 
feature in software.

🧠 Concept Overview
The Memento pattern involves three key components:

Role	Description
Originator	The object whose state needs to be saved and restored
Memento	  A snapshot of the Originator’s state
Caretaker	Manages the Memento but doesn’t modify it
This pattern is commonly used in undo/redo functionality in editors or games.
